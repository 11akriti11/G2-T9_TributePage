            <p>
                Marie Curie, née Maria Salomea Skłodowska, 
                (born November 7, 1867, Warsaw, Congress Kingdom of
                Poland, Russian Empire—died July 4, 1934, near Sallanches, 
                France), Polish-born French physicist, famous for her work 
                on radioactivity and twice a winner of the Nobel Prize. With 
                Henri Becquerel and her husband, Pierre Curie, she was awarded 
                the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics. She was the sole winner of the 
                1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a 
                Nobel Prize, and she is the only woman to win the award in two different 
                fields.

                Curie decided to do her thesis on radiation, recently 
                discovered in uranium by Henri Becquerel.

                This led her and her husband, Pierre, to the discovery 
                of a new element that was 400 times more radioactive 
                than uranium.

                        During World War I, Curie promoted the use of X-rays; 
                        she developed radiological cars - which later became 
                        known as “petites Curies” - to allow battlefield surgeons
                        to X-ray wounded soldiers and operate more accurately.

                        Both Curies were constantly ill from radiation sickness, and 
                        Marie Curie’s death from aplastic anemia in 1934, at age 66, 
                        was likely caused by radiation exposure.

                        A few of her books and papers are still

                        left a scientific legacy that is literally 
                        untouchable.
